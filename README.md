- Customers aged **40-50** have the highest bike purchases.
- Female customers have a slightly higher purchase rate.

#### Car Ownership Analysis
- **New South Wales** presents the biggest market opportunity as car owners and non-car owners are nearly equal.
- **Victoria (VIC) and Queensland (QLD)** have more car owners than non-car owners, indicating a different strategy may be needed.

### Model Development:
- **Targeting High-Value Customers:**
  - Aged **40-50**.
  - Higher proportion of **female** customers.
  - Work in **Financial Services, Manufacturing, and Health** industries.
  - Residing in **New South Wales and Victoria**.
